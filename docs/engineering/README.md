# Engineering notes

What was decided about this application and why — enough for someone building a system of this kind to
land it first time. One file per subject. Decisions, conventions, constraints and traps only: no
history, no defect records, no inventories that an ordinary feature would invalidate.

This application is a rewrite of `Codaxy.Inventory`, in the `inventory` repository, against the same
database. **[co-existence.md](co-existence.md) is the file to read first**: it says what cannot change
while both run, and why.

`domain.md` and `persistence.md` came from that repository and describe a database model this
application keeps exactly. They were reverse-engineered from its code, and say so; where one and the
database disagree, the database is what runs.

Build and run instructions live in the root `README.md`; the process for doing work lives in
`CLAUDE.md`.

| File | Subject |
| ---- | ------- |
| [principles.md](principles.md) | What this application is built to be, as against the one it replaces |
| [co-existence.md](co-existence.md) | Two applications on one database: what is frozen, what is copied, what is not shared |
| [domain.md](domain.md) | `Asset` and its one-to-one subtypes, codebooks, the entities that are not assets, inventory numbers |
| [persistence.md](persistence.md) | EF Core and Npgsql, COMB keys, migrate-and-seed at startup, the audit log |
| [auth.md](auth.md) | The session cookie, who may sign in, Google, one-time codes |
| [web-client.md](web-client.md) | CxJS with TypeScript, the route folder convention, the phone-first layout, the build |
| [deployment.md](deployment.md) | The image, compose and its profiles, ports, where credentials come from |
| [testing.md](testing.md) | The coverage threshold and what it is measured over, and what it may not hide |

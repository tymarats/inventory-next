# Web client

A CxJS single-page application in TypeScript, built by webpack into the server's `wwwroot`. One
deployable serves both, so there is no separate host and no CORS to configure.

## TypeScript and CxJS

CxJS ships its own typings, and `<cx>` blocks are compiled by `babel-preset-cx-env` rather than by
TypeScript. Two consequences:

- **`tsc` only type-checks; babel emits.** `npm run typecheck` is a separate step, and CI runs it.
- **The `<cx>` element is declared in `src/jsx.d.ts`, as an augmentation of React's JSX namespace**,
  not a global one. React's typings are what TypeScript resolves `JSX` from — `cx-react` pulls them
  in — and an augmentation of the global namespace does not merge with them. A `Property 'cx' does
  not exist` error means that file stopped being included.

Markup inside a `<cx>` block is not meaningfully type-checked: attributes are binding strings. The
types earn their place in controllers and the API layer, which is where the logic is.

## Structure

One folder per screen, mirroring the URL: `index.tsx` is the markup, `Controller.ts` the behaviour.
`src/api/*` is one module per resource, over `fetch` with `credentials: "same-origin"` — the session
is a cookie, so nothing attaches a token by hand.

Routing is declarative and the first matching route wins, so order in the JSX is the routing table.
The outermost split is whether there is a session; everything below it can assume the answer.

**The session is resolved once, at the root.** Until it arrives the app shows neither the sign-in
screen nor the application, which is what stops a signed-in person seeing a sign-in form for a moment
on every load.

## The phone is the hard case

Every screen is a single column that stops growing on a wide display, rather than a wide layout
squeezed into a narrow one. Tap targets are at least 44px high, which the default widget sizing does
not guarantee, and the page padding respects `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.

## Build

`npm run build` writes hashed bundles into `client/dist`, which the image copies into the server's
`wwwroot`.

**The application is always served by the server, on its own origin**, in development as in
production. In development the watcher writes only the shell to `wwwroot` — bundles stay in its
memory and the shell's `publicPath` points at `http://localhost:8765/` — so the page comes from the
server and the scripts come from the watcher.

That is the reason for the arrangement rather than the browser being handed to the dev server: the
session cookie is issued for, and confined to, the origin that serves the application. Point the
browser at the dev server instead and the cookie belongs to a node process, the origin differs from
production, and the dev server's own exposure becomes part of the authenticated surface.

**Hot replacement is `devServer.hot` plus `startHotAppLoop`**, which swaps the running application and
keeps the store and the current route rather than reloading the page. Losing either half turns every
edit into a full reload and a lost session.

## No Razor shell

`index.html` is written by the build and served as a static file. Razor earns its place when the HTML
has to be built per request — resolving hashed bundle names, choosing between development and
production script URLs, or passing a server-side value into the page — and none of those apply: the
plugin writes the names, `publicPath` decides the origin, and what the client needs to know it asks
`/api/auth/options` for.

**A Content-Security-Policy with a nonce would change that**, since a nonce is new per request and
must appear in both the header and every script tag. Script hashes in the header are the alternative
that a static shell supports. Worth deciding before there are screens, not after.

## Traps

**A CxJS layout is an imported widget, not a string.** `layout={{ type: "vbox" }}` compiles, reaches
the browser, and throws `Invalid widget type` at render — the screen is simply blank. Anything this
simple belongs in CSS anyway.

**The theme ships plain `.css` as well as the `.scss` written here**, so the build needs a rule for
both. With only the `.scss` rule the build still succeeds and the theme is quietly missing.

**Only `index.html` is written to `wwwroot` in development**, through `devMiddleware.writeToDisk`.
Letting the whole build land there leaves bundles the server will serve in place of the watcher's,
and an edit then appears to do nothing.

**Both ports are stated twice, in files that do not know about each other.** 8765 is
`devServer.port` and the `publicPath` in `webpack.config.js`; 5080 is `applicationUrl` in
`launchSettings.json` and what the browser is told to open. Change one half and the failure is
silent — the page loads from the server and asks for bundles nobody is serving.

**A shell written in development points at `http://localhost:8765`.** Running the server in
Production against that same `wwwroot` serves a page asking for a watcher that is not there; build
into `dist` and let the image copy it.

# Persistence

*Reverse-engineered from the code. It describes what the system does, not decisions recorded when they
were taken; correct it where it is wrong rather than working around it.*

PostgreSQL through EF Core and Npgsql. `InventoryContext` exposes one `DbSet` per entity and applies
every `IEntityTypeConfiguration` in the assembly — the entity classes carry no mapping attributes, so
mapping lives in `Persistence/Configurations/` or nowhere. Entities not named there run entirely on
convention.

## Naming

Tables and columns are snake_case and unquoted, through `EFCore.NamingConventions`. PostgreSQL folds
unquoted identifiers to lower case, so this is what lets a hand-written `select * from assets` work.

**A table is named after its entity, not after its `DbSet`**: `person`, not `persons`. `DbSet`s are
pluralised mechanically — `Informations`, `Confidentialities` — because that is how they read in C#
and because a mechanical rule needs no arguing about; tables take the CLR name through a loop in
`OnModelCreating`, so none of that reaches the schema.

**Key, index and foreign-key names still follow the `DbSet`**, giving
`fk_activation_assets_asset_id` on a table called `asset`. EF derives those before the loop renames
the table, and every way of correcting them afterwards is worse: clearing them makes EF rebuild them
after the naming convention has run, so they come back as `FK_Activation_Asset_AssetId`, and setting
them by hand bypasses the uniquifying EF does at PostgreSQL's 63-character limit, where the two
foreign keys on `electronic_device_type_electronic_device_tag` then collide. Constraint names are not
worth that, so they are left alone.

**The convention is applied in `InventoryContext.OnConfiguring`, not beside each `UseNpgsql`.** Three
places build a context — the app, the integration factory and the migrations fixture — and one that
configures the model differently from the others builds a model that no longer matches the snapshot.

It is a database convention only: the CLR entities and properties keep their PascalCase names, and
must, because the audit log has recorded them in every row it has ever written.

## Keys

Primary keys are GUIDs. New ids come from `RT.Comb`'s PostgreSQL provider, registered as
`ICombProvider`, so they are time-ordered and index-friendly. A service that creates an entity
allocates the id itself with `combProvider.Create()` rather than letting the database default it —
which is also what lets an asset and its subtype row share one key before either is inserted.

`Guid.NewGuid()` appears in seed data and in the audit log, where ordering does not matter.

Besides the primary keys, `Asset.InventoryNumber` carries the only unique constraint in the database.
Codebook names are not unique: whether two vendors may share one is a product question nobody has
answered, so the schema does not answer it either.

## Migrations

Applied at startup by `Database.Migrate()`, followed by the seeder. Both are skipped in the `Testing`
environment. There is no separate migration step in deployment: starting a container migrates the
database it points at.

**The migrations are the original's files, unchanged** — block-scoped namespaces and all, because
EF Core's generator ignores the file-scoped setting in `.editorconfig` and a converted history would
diverge from what the next `migrations add` writes. Everything else carried over was converted.

**Their designer files and the model snapshot are not history.** Each carries the CLR type names of
the model, so renaming a namespace has to reach them: the snapshot is what EF diffs against, and the
designers will not compile without it. The migration bodies name nothing but tables and columns and
never change.

**The history is copied from the original application and does not grow here** until that application
is deleted — see [co-existence.md](co-existence.md). A migration added on one side only would leave
the two describing different schemas with nothing to say which is right.

## Seeding

`SeedData()` is idempotent per table — each block runs only when its table is empty — and fills the
codebooks with the values the product expects. It is safe to run against a populated database, but it
will not repair or update a table that already has any row in it.

## Audit log

`AuditLogInterceptor` is a `SaveChangesInterceptor` registered on the context. For every added,
modified or deleted entity implementing `IIdentifiableReadOnly<Guid>`, it writes one `AuditLog` row
holding the table name, the entity id, the signed-in user's email (`"system"` when there is no HTTP
context), the action, and the complete before/after property set as JSON. `AuditLog` is excluded so
the log cannot log itself.

Rows written in one `SaveChanges` share a `TransactionId`.

## Traps

**An explicit `ToTable` or `HasColumnName` overrides the convention silently**, leaving one table in
PascalCase among snake_case neighbours with no error to say so — only a schema comparison finds it.
Nothing needs one now; adding one means spelling out what the convention would have produced anyway.

**The migrations history table is not covered by any migration.** EF reads it to decide what to apply,
so the convention renaming its columns locks out every database written before the convention landed.
`MigrationsHistoryNaming` renames them before `Migrate()`, and the rehearsal script repeats the same
SQL because `dotnet ef` does not go through startup. Both are deletable once no database predates the
naming migration.

**Seeded ids are mostly not stable.** Around 300 seeded rows take `Guid.NewGuid()` and a dozen take a
literal GUID, so most codebook ids differ between every database that was ever seeded separately.
Nothing may hard-code one, and data cannot be moved between environments by id. The client already
works around it by looking codebook entries up by text.

**The audit log stores every column of every tracked row, in clear.** That includes licence key
identifiers and anything in `Information` marked as personal data. It is readable by every signed-in
user — see [auth.md](auth.md).

**`TransactionId` names something that does not exist.** No code opens a transaction, so the value is
a fresh GUID per `SaveChanges`. It groups a save, and reading it as a business transaction is wrong.

**The interceptor captures `HttpContext` in its constructor**, so it attributes writes correctly only
on the request scope that resolved it; anything saving outside a request records `"system"`. Its
synchronous `SavingChanges` blocks on the async path with `.Result`.

**An instant must be `DateTimeOffset`.** It maps to `timestamp with time zone` and keeps its offset
all the way to the browser, which is why `AuditLog.TimeCreated` and `Asset.LastModified` display
correctly. A plain `DateTime` reaches the client with no zone and is read there as local time —
behind by the viewer's offset.

**A calendar date is `DateOnly` and a `date` column.** Purchase, activation, manufacturing,
expiration and due dates are the same day in every timezone. Given a `DateTime` they are not: the
client sends local midnight with its offset, `System.Text.Json` applies it, and a UTC server stores
the day before at 22:00 or 23:00 — then re-saving the record walks it back again. `DateOnly` has
nowhere for an offset to be applied, which is the whole of the fix; a server or container timezone
setting is not.

**Migrations that declare no store type resolve it when they are applied**, which is how the same
history produced `timestamp without time zone` through the app and `timestamp with time zone` through
`dotnet ef`. A migration whose column type matters states it, or the two diverge and only
`MigrationsTests` notices.

**`JsonTextWriter` throws on a type it does not recognise**, rather than falling back to `ToString`.
`TrackedChanges` converts `DateOnly` by hand for that reason; anything newer than `DateTime` reaching
an audited entity needs the same, or every save of that entity fails.

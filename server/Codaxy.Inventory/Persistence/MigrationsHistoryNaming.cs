/// A database written before the convention landed holds <c>MigrationId</c> and
/// <c>ProductVersion</c> while EF asks for <c>migration_id</c>, and no migration can fix that
/// because none of them gets to run.
///
/// So it is renamed here, before <c>Migrate()</c>. Idempotent, and a no-op on a database that
/// never had the old names. Deletable once every database has started at least once on this
